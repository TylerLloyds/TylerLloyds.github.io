    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Tyler, and right now I’m working toward my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at UMass Boston. I’ve always been curious about how technology works and how it connects people, and that curiosity has grown into a real passion for learning about programming, problem-solving, and building things that can make life easier or more interesting. I don’t see myself as just a student checking boxes for a degree — I’m someone who wants to understand the bigger picture of how computers shape the world we live in.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I started out at Marshfield High School, where I spent a lot of time figuring out what I cared about and what I wanted to do with my future. High school gave me a foundation, but college has been where I’ve really started to grow. At the University of Massachusetts Boston, I’m on the Computer Science BS track. It’s challenging, but I enjoy the process of learning new concepts, even when they’re tough. Every class feels like another step toward becoming someone who can contribute to the field of technology in a meaningful way.</p>

  <section id="life">
    <h2>Life & Interests</h2>
    <p>Outside of academics, I try to keep a balance between studying and living life. I enjoy exploring new ideas, whether that’s through coding projects, reading, or just having conversations with people who think differently than I do. I like seeing how different perspectives can change the way you look at a problem. I also enjoy the simple things — spending time with friends, listening to music, or just taking a break to clear my head. I think being human means more than just chasing grades or career goals; it’s about finding meaning in the everyday moments too.</p>
